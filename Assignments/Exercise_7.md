# Exercise 7 What an interviewer looks for in reponses.

## Objective

_Each chapter in the book ends with an interview question followed by the analysis of what an
interviewer would look for in an answer. Write one of these yourself. 
Start with an interview question you have asked or one that you’ve been asked (or one from the
internet). Then write up what an interviewer would look for in an answer. Be specific about how
the interviewer might help the interviewee if they get stuck.
Note: this is intended to be a relatively short assignment to give you time to work on your final
project._

## Response

I've been on an interview panel as an interviewer far more times than as a candidate.

Although the initial interview has a set of fixed questions for all candidates, subsequent interviews 
are typically more interesting to explore specific strengths and weaknesses.

Many times, the actual questions are irrelevant. The objective is to get candidates _talking_. The
questions are typically just icebreakers to get started on a technical conversation. Yes, it is true
that the questions can be used to weed people out that are completely unqualified. But the reality is that 
if HR is doing their job (and the candidate is honest), by the time an interview comes around the issue 
should be more about _how new problems are solved_. The same questions for different candidates is not
only fair - but it makes the selection process easier for interviewers to compare responses.

One possible question:  _How would you get data from/to a database from application/device/etc?_

That's a pretty open-ended question. By the time the interview is happening, the candidate should know
that we're a C#/SQL shop, and will hopefully get started on that route for an answer. If not, minor
penalty for not paying attention to the job specification.

What I look for, beyond technical competence: attitude, enthusiasm, motivation, methodology.

Does the candidate seem genuinely interested in software development? Are previous examples of something 
similar referenced? If they don't know the answer, what methods are used to _find_ the answer? 

Once the basic question is answered, then depending on the quality of the response, I will typically "grow" the
problem: start adding new and more complex requirements such as dealing with millions of rows of data,
security / firewall issues, etc.  "_What if this?_", and "_Have you considered that?_". Again, it is all
about getting a candidate to talk and ultimately reveal the methodology for problem solving and the
underlying attitude.

Interviewers can help by just encouraging the candidate to just _relax_. There's nothing wrong with giving part
of an answer. Everyone is anxious and nervous during an interview. Everyone knows this. The interview
is just to ensure that the resume reflects reality. Anything beyond that is looking for _best fit_ with regards 
to personality. I'd choose someone with perhaps less technical skill, but with a great attitude over someone
with a poor attitude pretty much any day of the week. Technical skills are much easier to teach.

My best advice for interviewer: help the candidate feel at ease and relaxed.

My best advice for a candidate: relax. Be yourself.
