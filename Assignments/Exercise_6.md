# Exercise 6 Review the final project instructions. 

## Put together a preliminary rough draft of your final report.

See the WIP [Final Project Document](./Final_Project.md) and the [supplementary instructions](./Final_Project_Instructions.md).

> This is intended to be a planning exercise, not that you should have your project complete
(though it makes the report easier to write if you put it in present/past tense instead of putting in
“should” and “shall”).

## As you work through the draft final report, note where you might have trouble. 

The [Final Project Challenges](./Final_Project.md#Challenges) lists tasks that may be difficult to address.


## Make a list of the tasks you want to complete for the project. 

The [Minimum Project Requirements](./Final_Project.md#Challenges#Minimum-Project-Requirements) should certainly be completed:

	[(a) Use a Cortex-M processor](./Final_Project.md#a-use-a-cortex-m-processor)
	[(b) Have a button that causes an interrupt](./Final_Project.md#b-have-a-button-that-causes-an-interrupt)
	[(c) Use at least three peripherals such as ADC, DAC, PWM LED, Smart LED, LCD, sensor, BLE](./Final_Project.md#c-use-at-least-three-peripherals-such-as-adc-dac-pwm-led-smart-led-lcd-sensor-ble)
	[(d) Have serial port output](./Final_Project.md#d-have-serial-port-output)
	[(e) Implement an algorithmic piece that makes the system interesting](./Final_Project.md#e-implement-an-algorithmic-piece-that-makes-the-system-interesting)
	[(f) Implement a state machine](./Final_Project.md#f-implement-a-state-machine)

Beyond the requirements for the class, ideas to consider:

* Solar power
* LoRa communication
* Internet conenctivity: web page to view weight, some sort of MQTT publish/subscribe/history.
* Design a PCB with minimum components and all hardware used properly embedded with no prototype mechanical dupont conenctors.

## Make a list of the minimum viable project and any blocking items (unacquired hardware, difficulty with toolchains).

The minimum viable project will be a system that:

* Read the weight and convert to digital value.
* Display the weight.

## Include any relevant pieces from past assignments (such as the state machine documentation from Exercise 5).

* The [Exercise 2 Idea Project Diagram](./Exercise_2_1.md#idea-project-diagram) is a helpful overview.
* [Exercise 4 Buttons Registers](./Exercise_4.md#what-are-the-button-registers-that-you-read)

Turn in your document or a link to a github document before 9am on Saturday, January 15.
