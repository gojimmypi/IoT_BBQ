# Exercise 6 Review the final project instructions. 

## Put together a preliminary rough draft of your final report.

See the WIP [Final Project Document](./Final_Project.md) and the [supplementary instructions](./Final_Project_Instructions.md).

This is intended to be a planning exercise, not that you should have your project complete
(though it makes the report easier to write if you put it in present/past tense instead of putting in
“should” and “shall”).

## As you work through the draft final report, note where you might have trouble. 

The [Final Project Challenges](./Final_Project.md#Challenges) lists tasks that may be difficult to address.


## Make a list of the tasks you want to complete for the project. 

The [Minimum Project Requirements](./Final_Project.md#Challenges#Minimum-Project-Requirements) should certainly be completed:

## Make a list of the minimum viable project and any blocking items (unacquired hardware, difficulty with toolchains).




## Include any relevant pieces from past assignments (such as the state machine documentation from Exercise 5).

Turn in your document or a link to a github document before 9am on Saturday, January 15.
