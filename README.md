ESP8266 Based Temperature and Propane Tank Weight Project

First you need a NodeMCU ESP8266 like this one:

Note it has a CH340G USB chip, so works well with Windows 10

In the \Resources\Binaries directory, there are Lua formware images (one support floats, the other only ints)

Once you've uploaded the image, this tool can be helpful for getting Lua code onto your device:
